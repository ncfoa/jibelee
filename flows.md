## Overview

The P2P Delivery Platform is a sophisticated microservices-based system that connects travelers with customers who need items delivered. The platform handles complex workflows across 9 core services, managing everything from user authentication to real-time tracking and payments.

### Key Business Model
- **Travelers** create trips with available capacity for carrying items
- **Customers** post delivery requests for items they need transported
- **Smart Matching Algorithm** connects travelers and customers based on routes, timing, and preferences
- **QR Code Verification** ensures secure pickup and delivery
- **Dynamic Pricing** optimizes costs based on multiple factors
- **Escrow Payments** protect both parties during the delivery process
